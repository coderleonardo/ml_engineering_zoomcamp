# Machine Learning Engineering (Zoomcamp) - Data Talks 

## 1 - Introduction to Machine Learning

### 1.1 - Introduction to Machine Learning
Some introduction concepts about machine learning like 

		- *features* and *targets*
		- features + targets -> ML -> Model
		- How to make predictions	
			- features + model -> predictions
		- When use machine learning
	
### 1.2 - Machine Learning vs Rule-Based Systems
Some cases about ML vs Rule-Based Systems

		- When to use ML or Rule-Based Systems
		- How to maintain a performative model
		- Applications
	
### 1.3 - Supervised Machine Learning
Formalization of some concepts about machine learning like *supervised learning*

		- Feature Matrix and target vector: (X, y)
			- Regression
			- Classification
			- Ranking
	    	- g(X) ~ y, where g is the model, X is the feature matrix and y the target
		
### 1.4 - CRISP-DM
Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) for developing a machine learning project:

		- Step 1 (Business understanding): define a measurable goal (do we need ML?)
		- Step 2 (Data understanding): do we have the data? Is it good?
		- Step 3 (Data preparation): transform data into a table, so we can put it into ML
		- Step 4 (Modeling): to select the best model, use the validation set
		- Step 5 (Evaluation): validate that the goal is reached
		- Step 6 (Deployment): roll out to production to all the users
    
### 1.5 - Model Selection
Model selection steps:

	    - Step 1: Split data into train/validation/test
	    - Step 2: Train a model
	    - Step 3: Validate it
	    - Step 4: Select the best model
	    - Step 5: Test it
	    Iterate: start simple, learn from the feedback, improve
